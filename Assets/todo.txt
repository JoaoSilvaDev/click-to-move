[] interactable types
    [x] action, things that cause an action (ex: door, open close)
    [x] remote, things that cause an action on other things (ex: lever to draw bridge, sign that opens a read UI)
    [x] picup, things you can pick up (ex: bones, leaves) (requires inventory)
    [x] resource, things you can break and get items from  (ex: trees, rocks) (requires inventory)
        [x] frequency of hits
        [x] give items
        [x] health
        [x] destroy

[] refactor interactables
    make addon components that subscribe to interactable functions.
    so you put the Interactable base component and add these to add the functionality you need
    [x] InteractablePickup
    [x] InteractableAction
            InteractableObstacle (use the Action one, but the obstacle logic is in the object script like Door.cs)
            InteractableRemote (use the Action one, and drag a different object to the inspector UnityEvent)
    [x] InteractableResource

[] fix trees not syncing obstacles properly

[] interactable hover visuals
    maybe per type?
        if you can pickup it shows something
        if its a resource, something else
        maybe thats useful

[] inventory
    [x] base inventory logic
    [x] add items
    [x] pickup item
    [] move items
    [] swap items
    [] drop items (can also be used by interactables, when dropping loot)

[] auto bake navmesh in editor or smth

item types
    [] consumable (gives something non physical to the player and is removed from  inventory)
    [] placeable (creates a prefab in the world and is removed from  inventory)
    [] equipable (gives something physical to the player when in a specific slot (can be moved back))
